        <h1>Privacy Policy for SearchWord</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: 6 July 2025</em></p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how SearchWord ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the SearchWord website (the "Service").</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect and Use</h2>
        <p>SearchWord is designed to be a privacy-friendly game. We do not require you to create an account or provide any personal identification information to play.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> We use your browser's local storage to save your game progress. This includes your found words, score, timer status, and settings (like theme preference). This data is stored only on your device and is not transmitted to our servers. You can clear this data at any time via the in-game "Settings" menu.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> We use third-party services that may place cookies on your device. You can manage your consent for these cookies via the Cookiebot consent banner.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party services to operate and improve the game:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics to collect anonymous usage data, such as the number of visitors and which features are most popular. This helps us understand how the game is being used so we can improve it. This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally.</li>
            <li><strong>Google AdSense:</strong> We use Google AdSense to display advertisements, which helps support the operational costs of the game. AdSense may use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to this and other websites.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookiebot:</strong> We use Cookiebot to manage your consent for cookies used by our third-party services, in compliance with privacy regulations.</li>
            <li><strong>Dictionary & Profanity APIs:</strong> We make anonymous requests to a dictionary API for word definitions and a profanity filter API to maintain a family-friendly environment. No personal data is sent with these requests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>All game-related data is stored in your browser's local storage. You have full control to delete this data by using the "Delete All Data" button in the "Settings" menu within the game.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
